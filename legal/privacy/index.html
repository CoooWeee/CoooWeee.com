                                <p>The above only relates to your Personal Data and does not relate to any aggregated or other information that may be developed or created internally by us, provided this other information cannot later be used or combined with other information to identify you in any way whatsoever and therefore maintains our privacy commitment to you.</p>

                                    <li>ThunderTarsier has a legitimate reason to add your email address to ThunderTarsier’s email marketing database at the time of account creation in ThunderTarsier so that ThunderTarsier can send you the Welcome Email which has instructions &amp;tips for using the app for the first time.
