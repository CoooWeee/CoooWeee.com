                            <p>ThunderTarsier (“us”, “we”, or “our”) uses cookies on the CoooWeee.com website and the CoooWee mobile application (the “Service”). By using the Service, you consent to the use of cookies.</p>
                            <p>Our Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how third-parties we may partner with may use cookies on the Service, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies.</p>
                            <p>We use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow us to measure activity on the web site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the web site without re-registering. Cookies are used by us to measure activity on the web site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.</p>
                            <h3>What are cookies</h3>
                            <p>Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Service or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.</p>
                            <p>Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.</p>
                            <h3>How ThunderTarsier uses cookies</h3>
                            <p>When you use and access the Service, we may place a number of cookies files in your web browser.</p>
                            <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
                            <p>To enable certain functions of the Service</p>
                            <p>To provide analytics</p>
                            <p>To store your preferences</p>
                            <p>To enable advertisements delivery, including behavioral advertising</p>
                            <p>We use both session and persistent cookies on the Service and we use different types of cookies to run the Service:</p>
                            <p>Essential cookies. We may use cookies to remember information that changes the way the Service behaves or looks, such as a user’s language preference on the Service.</p>
                            <p>Accounts-related cookies. We may use accounts-related cookies to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. We may use these cookies to remember information that changes the way the Service behaves or looks, such as the “remember me” functionality.</p>
                            <p>Analytics cookies. We may use analytics cookies to track information how the Service is used so that we can make improvements. We may also use analytics cookies to test new advertisements, pages, features or new functionality of the Service to see how our users react to them.</p>
                            <p>Advertising cookies. These type of cookies are used to deliver advertisements on and through the Service and track the performance of these advertisements. These cookies may also be used to enable third-party advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your activities or interests.</p>
                            <p>We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest), we do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.</p>
                            <h3>Third-party cookies</h3>
                            <p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-parties cookies to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver advertisements on and through the Service, and so on. This is standard in the Internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policies.</p>
                            <h3>What are your choices regarding cookies</h3>
